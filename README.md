## About this project
The goal of the website is to view cute pictures of animals. The site is entirely made in HMTL/CSS/JS without any frameworks or libraries.

## Testing and adaptations
Part of the excercise was to test your website to a potential user, and adapt the website based on the results.

### Test one
The results of the website was pretty clear, it was a bit of a mess. The user lost himself in the content, and didn't really know what the purpose was, and what the most important content was.
What I mainly changed, is that I made some content more important than other content.

### Test two
I did the second test after I adapted the website based on the results of the first test. The user didn't really have any problem with using the website, other than he remarked that the website didn't really have interactivity.

It is not really noticable, but if you look closely, you can see that the second picture on the upper row is a bit bigger than the rest. This gets triggered when the user hovers on the picture. This works with all pictures

## Design Principles
For the project, we had to implement at least 3 of the 19 Design Principles by Paul Rand: http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/

The Design Principles I implemented are:
- 1 Clarity is job
- 10 Consistency matters
- 11 Strong visual hierarchies work best

### Clarity is job
I think my website is very clear in what the purpose is. The user recognizes the used patters of the gallery.
