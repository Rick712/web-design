            <h3>A kitty</h3>
            <p>This kitty is very cute. What is really special, is the contrast between the foreground and the background. It almost represents the struggle of life. The photographer clearly shows that he has an internal fight between his good side and his bad side, and shows that the bad side is winning. But better times are coming, hence the cute face of the kitty.</p>
