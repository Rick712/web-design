## About this project

The goal of the website is to view cute pictures of animals. The site is entirely made in HMTL/CSS/JS without any frameworks or libraries.

## Testing and adaptations

Part of the excercise was to test your website to a potential user, and adapt the website based on the results.

### Test one

The results of the website was pretty clear, it was a bit of a mess. The user lost himself in the content, and didn't really know what the purpose was, and what the most important content was.
What I mainly changed, is that I made some content more important than other content.

### Test two

I did the second test after I adapted the website based on the results of the first test. The user didn't really have any problem with using the website, other than he remarked that the website didn't really have interactivity.
He knew the pictures were clickable, but someone that doesn't know that the pictures are clickable might not know how to used the website.

It is not really noticable, but if you look closely, you can see that the second picture on the upper row is a bit bigger than the rest. This gets triggered when the user hovers on the picture. This works with all pictures

## Design Principles

For the project, we had to implement at least 3 of the 19 Design Principles by Paul Rand: http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/

The Design Principles I implemented are:
- 1 Clarity is job
- 10 Consistency matters
- 11 Strong visual hierarchies work best

### Clarity is job

I think my website is very clear in what the purpose is. The user recognizes the used patters of the gallery, and easely knows what he can do on the page.

### Consistency matters

Every picture, except for the featured picture, has the same size and the same hover transition, which is very consitent. Every normal text has the same font family, but only the headers are bigger and have a higher font weight. Ther margin between the pictures are roughly the same.

### Strong visual hierarchies work best

When you visit the page, the header really attracts attention from the user. The next thing that attracts attention is the featured picture of the day, and then the header of the featured picture of the day. The attention flow is logical, and is exactly as I intended it to be. Also, the featured animal of the day is visually more appealing than the All pictures part.
